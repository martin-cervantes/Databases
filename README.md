# Databases

This project will test the domain of SQL queries by retrieve and organize
different pieces of data from a table.

Data is the core of any good web application and a good working knowledge
of SQL is very useful. That knowledge allows us not only to understand what
is happening behind the scenes but also to feel comfortable asking more
complicated questions about the data that our application can provide.
And that's what SQL is really about: asking your database questions and
occasionally adding or changing things in it as well.
